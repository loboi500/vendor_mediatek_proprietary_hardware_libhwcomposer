This directory contains HWComposer HAL interface, which defines the interface of
HWComposer and is used to build a hwcomposer shared library.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

HWComposer is the implementation that leverages HW IPs to
share the workload of GPU, which reduces the power consumption and
accelerates the rendering performance.

This is a dummy HWComposer. We remove the complex software code flow and hardware
control flow. It use the simplest way to post client traget buffer to display.
Then it can help us to bring up a new platform fast.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libui.so
2.  libutils.so
3.  libcutils.so
4.  libsync.so
5.  libhardware.so
6.  libnativewindow
7.  android.hardware.graphics.common@1.*
8.  android.hardware.graphics.composer@2.*
9.  android.hardware.graphics.mapper@2.*

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  hwcomposer.mtk_common.a

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Files in this directory is used to
generate a shared library 'libsimplehwc.so'.

The shared library 'libsimplehwc.so' is loaded and invoked by
HWComposer service at runtime when bring up.


All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
